# MarieCoder 🧹✨

> "The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life." — Marie Kondo

**MarieCoder** is a premium, mindful AI coding partner for VS Code. She doesn't just write code; she cultivates it. Inspired by the **KonMari** philosophy, Marie helps you build software that is intentional, pure, and a joy to maintain.

## 🌸 Why MarieCoder?

Unlike traditional AI assistants that focus on bulk output, Marie prioritizes **clarity** and **structural integrity**. She treats your codebase as a "Living Garden," ensuring every modification respects your architectural boundaries and naming rituals.

### 🧠 Core Philosophy
- **Intent over Output**: Marie asks "Why?" before "How?".
- **Joy Zoning**: Strict enforcement of the "Downward Flow Law" (Domain -> Infrastructure -> Plumbing).
- **Gratitude & Letting Go**: A surgical approach to refactorings and "Composting" (safe deletion) of technical debt.

## 🛠️ Key Capabilities

- **✨ Multi-Provider Intelligence**: Native support for **Anthropic**, **OpenRouter**, and **Cerebras** (Ultra-fast inference).
- **🩹 Sovereign Recovery**: Advanced failure handling. If a tool fails, Marie uses high-order diagnostics to pivot strategies.
- **👻 Ghost Text Previews**: Real-time Editor previews of proposed changes with live sync status icons.
- **⚓ Strategic Memory**: Pin critical context (symbols, snippets, or files) to ensure a stable architectural memory across sessions.
- **🏗️ Autonomous Structural Tools**: From mass project re-zoning to logical clustering and semantic refactoring.
